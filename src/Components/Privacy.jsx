            <p>
              Once you have used your card, there is a lag to your payment
              reaching the bank and confirmation received by our payment
              gateway. In most cases, the payments are received well in time but
              there are instances where there is a downtime on the issuing
              bank’s server due to maintenance or other technical faults. In the
              event that this happens, your payment request is turned down. You
              will then hear from our Customer Care who will help you through
              the process.
